# car-prediction-regression

The Car Prediction Regression project aims to develop a linear regression model capable of predicting car prices based on various features that influence the value of the car, such as horsepower, weight, manufacturing year, and other attributes. In this project, a linear regression algorithm is employed to model the relationship between independent variables (car features) and the dependent variable (car price).
